# 30 Days 30Projects

This repo includes my the projects for my **#30Days30Projects challenge**. 
The projects are developed mainly with HTML, CSS, JavaScript most of the ideas are website landing pages implementing a particular programming paradigm / skill.
All landing pages will be designed in AdobeXD first then implemented as a website.

I did this because I thought it would be fun!.

I started this challenge on **23rd of June 2020** to finish on the  **14th of July 2020** 

I am sharing each day's progress on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dqve) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-ayo/).
